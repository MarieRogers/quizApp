# quiz

> A Vue.js project

This quiz project built with Vue.js allows users to work through small quizzes, calculating score and movement through the quiz. 

I had no significant conversations about the project, and I referenced Duvall's examples, the Vue documentation, W3 schools, and stack overflow.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
